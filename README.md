# NC-News

Here is the hosted link: https://nc-news-lee.netlify.app/

## Description

This is a news article app build using React. Each article has votes and comments, both of which the user can interact with. You can navigate to specific articles by clicking the relevant articles link, you can also use the navigation bar to view articles by category or head to the user or home page. You have the ability to change the logged in user and only then can you delete comments by that specific user. React-Bootstrap was used to develop the UI.

I have used Axios to make HTTP requests to the REST endpoint API developed during my back end project for this app.
